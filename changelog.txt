Version 1.4.0 (2026-01-14)

     Python 3 Port & Single-Player Refactor
     
     This release modernizes Frets on Fire for current systems. The game has
     been ported to Python 3 and refactored to a single-player only architecture,
     removing all legacy networking code while preserving the original gameplay.
     
     Python 3 Migration:
     * Ported to Python 3.8+ compatibility (tested with Python 3.12).
     * Ran 2to3 conversion and applied manual fixes throughout codebase.
     * Fixed asyncore removal in Python 3.12 (removed dependency).
     * Fixed Cerealizer/pickle compatibility issues.
     * Replaced deprecated StringType with str.
     * Replaced deprecated sha module with hashlib.
     * Fixed ConfigParser encoding for Python 3.
     * Fixed Image.tostring() to Image.tobytes() for Pillow compatibility.
     * Fixed pygame event.str to event.unicode.
     * Fixed sort() cmp parameter to use key parameter (Python 3 style).
     * Fixed file() builtin to use io.IOBase.
     * Fixed __cmp__ to __eq__/__ne__ in Svg.py.
     * Fixed gettext .decode() removal (Python 3 gettext returns str).
     * Fixed MIDI module for Python 3 bytes/string handling.
     * Fixed StringIO to BytesIO in MIDI output.
     * Fixed configparser string value requirement in Song.py.
     * Fixed MidiInfoReader.Done exception reference.

     Single-Player Refactor:
     * Refactored to single-player only architecture.

       World, Lobby, Messages, asyncore dependency).
     * Created new SinglePlayer.py module for simplified game management.
     * Simplified Scene.py by removing message handling code.
     * Updated MainMenu.py to use SinglePlayerSession directly.

     * Fixed "Return to Song" button in pause menu.
     * Fixed input handling so F1-F5 keys work as frets during gameplay.
     * Added proper paused state to prevent game from ending while paused.
