Building and installing Frets on Fire
-------------------------------------

Running the game
----------------

First, the following supporting Python libraries should be installed.

	- Python 3.8 or later
	- Pygame
	- PyOpenGL and a video card with recent OpenGL drivers
	- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
	- NumPy
	- Optional: vorbis-tools for importing Guitar Hero (tm) songs

After this, the game can be started by running the src/FretsOnFire.py file. For
example, in Linux, macOS, and Windows this can be done from the terminal with the
following commands:

	$ cd src
	$ python FretsOnFire.py

For Windows, ensure Python is in PATH.

Updating translations
---------------------

First, make sure you have installed the gettext package that provides the msgfmt tool.
Then, run the following command:

        $ cd data && make translations

Updating graphics files
-----------------------

Frets on Fire requires that all graphic files be provided in the PNG format. 
If you have changed any of the source SVG files, first make sure that Inkscape
is installed. Then, run the following command:

        $ cd data && make graphics
